PVSRA


What is PVSRA? 

PVSRA stands for Price, Volume, Support, Resistance Analysis. The purpose of PVSRA is to:

1. Determine if the MMs (Market Makers) are bulls or bears.
2. Determine if the price movement is in the MM's "Run for Profits" or "Position Building" phase.

Price includes consideration of individual candlestick configurations (example: hammer, engulfing,....see "Essence of Sonic R" in Post #1) as well as any visible pattern (example: Head & Shoulders) and the wave action in general (example: higher H/Ls or lower H/Ls), keeping in mind that prices tend to move in inter-day swings of 100+, 150+, 200+, 250+, etc. pips. Where price might be in a swing can determine if the price movement is in the "Run for Profits" or the "Position Building" phase.

Volume is the count of trades on the broker server (currency size undisclosed) and what we are looking for are notable increases relative to preceding volumes. The M1 chart is excellent for spotting if higher trading activity is occurring at highs or lows. The M1 chart does not reveal the status of MMs continuously due to times of conflicting signals. However, when the MMs activity will provide clues, they will stand out in real-time best on the M1 chart.

Support and Resistance refers primarily to the quarter divisions between whole numbers, with whole numbers, half numbers and finally the 1/4 and 3/4 numbers being important in that order. Other support and resistance areas formed by past price action are also to be considered.


Why Do PVSRA?

Price Action 
Price action (including wave analysis) is not by itself a good way to determine the chance for success of a trade “opportunity”. The reason is that at any time the price can move in a totally unexpected fashion.

Volume
Volume, or more accurately the number of trades executed via the broker (with currency size undisclosed) is not by itself a good way to determine the chance for success of a trade “opportunity”. The reason is that at any time the price can move in a totally unexpected fashion.

Support and Resistance
Just because price is at a key S&R area does not by itself help to determine the chance for success of a trade “opportunity”. The reason is that at any time the price can move in a totally unexpected fashion.

PVSRA
The analysis of all three of the above, across multiple TF charts, is a better way to determine the chance for success of a trade “opportunity”. However, at any time the price can move in a totally unexpected fashion.

Building a Trade
Because at any time the price can move in a totally unexpected fashion, a sole trade entry is a disadvantaged way to trade. It is arrogant to think we know the “best” time and place to start a trade. The fact is, Market Makers respond to the cumulative affect of trade entries by moving prices to make them “less than the best”, stopping them out, and increasing their own profits. Being able to compensate for shifting prices caused by the Market Makers, by adding to the trade at various other times and places, is a better way to improve the chance for success of the trade.

Conclusion 
The "Truth" about markets is the only thing we can be certain of is that there is nothing we can be certain of. Perform PVSRA to help qualify a trade "opportunity" because it is the best way to do so. Should you enter a trade, do so with the capability and intent to build the trade using multiple small entries instead of a single large entry, in order to take advantage of the Market Makers that are trying to take advantage of you.


How Do We Do PVSRA?

The premise behind PVSRA is that bull MMs prefer buying below key S&R and bear MMs prefer selling above key S&R. It will help us to determine if the MMs are bulls or bears by finding out where (above or below key S&R) they are doing most of their trading. This is not the only consideration, of course, but it is a helpful one. We also need to determine if the MMs are in a "Position Building" phase (running price opposite their status), or if they are in a "Run for Profits" phase (running price per their status). It is the "Run for Profits" phase that we want to trade. There is less risk to us if we are trading in the direction per the status of the MMs when the MMs are pushing the price in that direction. For example, if the MMs are bulls, then we want to trade long, but only when the bull MMs are in their bull "Run for Profits" phase. We do not want to trade long when the bull MMs are in their bull "Position Building" phase, because we cannot know how long that phase will last and the longer it lasts the lower the price is going! Let's see how the MMs work, and how and where they change status.

Starting with the turn of a trend, for example a new trend with prices moving upwards, the MMs have started their bull "Run for Profits" phase. These bull MMs have already been building long positions in the latter part of the previous down trend, and during any ranging of the price before the new up trend started. That was their bull "Position Building" phase. The bull MMs will continue adding longs in the new up trend direction. They will do this during retraces downwards, possibly taking price below key S&R to add longs. This is a long trading opportunity, early in a fresh up trend when the bull MMs are focused on adding longs at retrace lows. At a point during the up trend, the MMs will shift from a bull "Run for Profit" to a bear "Position Building" phase. PVSRA will start showing the MMs as bears instead of bulls. The price will still be moving up, but the bear MMs are now focused on highs as sellers, to close longs and build short. They will still be adding longs at lows in order to continue to profit as they continue to push price up. And they will continue to push the price up in order to deceive longs into buying so there will be liquidity the bear MMs need to close their longs and open shorts. This is where the bear MMs begin the bear "Position Building" phase. It will continue until the price reaches the top and possibly goes to ranging. We cannot know how long or how high bear MMs will push price up during the bear "Position Building" phase, but eventually the bear MMs will turn the price downwards starting the bear "Run for Profits" phase. The bear MMs will continue to add shorts in the new down trend direction. They will do this during retraces upwards, possibly taking price above key S&R to add shorts. This is a short trading opportunity, the time early in a fresh trend down when the bear MMs are focused on adding shorts at retrace highs.

To summarize, think of it this way. Bulls can trend prices down for buying (position building) before they start trending prices up for profit, but even during the early trend up (run for profits) they pull prices back down to add more longs. The trading opportunity here is to trade long on retraces early in the bull "Run for Profits". Bears can trend prices up for selling (position building) before they start trending prices down for profit, but even during the early trend down (Run for Profits) they pull prices back up to add more shorts. The trading opportunity here is to trade short on retraces early in the bear "Run for Profits". It is extremely important that you understand, even though we can determine if the MMs are bulls or bears, we cannot know when they will finish position building and turn prices in the profit making direction. To avoid getting trapped in a trade that is in the "Run for Profits" direction, during a prolonged "Position Building" phase in the opposite direction, it is best to wait for a trading opportunity on a retrace early in the "Run for Profit" phase. This means you will not be trading "tops and bottoms". Instead, you will be performing the analysis we call PVSRA to determine if the MMs are bulls or bears and to determine where the price action is in overall inter-day swings, looking for a corresponding bull or bear "Run for Profits" phase. You will be looking for a Classic setup trading opportunity on a pullback early in the "Run for Profits" phase.


Be Patient, Learning PVSRA Takes Time

Becoming proficient with PVSRA is like becoming proficient with an art. It will take time for you to learn to "read" what the charts have to say. But this is the essence of becoming a successful trader. Price, volume and S&R are totally unrelated "technicals" and are absolutely the three most important "technicals" in trading. When you learn to put these three things together, to see what the chart is saying, you will have mastered what truly matters. You will have mastered how the market really works! This is what indicator dependent traders never master because they are too busy looking for solely price derivative/price lagging indicators to "suggest" to them the future!
