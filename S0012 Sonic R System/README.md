###A Sonicdeejay Story
Hi Fellow Traders, My name is Sonic. Before you do anything else in trading, I want you to read The 5 Steps to becoming a trader (5 steps pdf. below). I have been trading now since 2008 and been full with cheers and tears. Just like many of you. I started out looking for the holy grail indicators that gives buy/sell with no loss. Soon, I found out that my trading statement is going nowhere, with messy charts and too many indicators to confirm, and causing the late signal trigger; minimizing my wins and maximizing my losses. I start to realize that indicators are all based on prices, according to their formula, causing them to lag behind the price movement. After reading many books, crawling different systems and LIVE trading, I have come to a conclusion. There is no "mechanical" systems or indicators that can really predict where the price will go with 60~100% accuracy.The market doesn't care about "mechanical" systems and indicators. I came to understand the importance of Trade/Risk Management, of the general trend (Bias), and S&R. So, I started Sonic R with the intention to share and learn from traders alike. Few comes and goes, until **traderathome** came along. He is a great man with pure heart. He put countless hours into our Sonic R templates and educating others. We will not be where we are here without his endless support.

###The Rise of Sonic R
So, here is a simple and profitable 15M swing system inspired from Raghee's book. A blindly followed moving averages system can be very successful in trending market, but I am around here long enough to witness the failure of it when the market goes into ranging periods. So, I fine tuned the system with understanding analysis of <span style="color:red">**Price**</span> (individual candles and waves formed by them), a little bit of <span style="color:red">**Volume**</span> and <span style="color:red">**Support & Resistance**</span>,.... <span style="color:red">**Price,Volume,S&R Analysis (PVSRA)**</span>. I am getting high success rate now. It is not the magic bullet. Nothing is. It is an elegantly simple and effective EMA based system. I'd like to call it the <span style="color:blue">**Sonic R. System**</span>.

Latest Templates/Indicators (2014 Release)
The zip file at the bottom of this post contains the indicators/templates. See HERE for overview and instructions, and read a user guide HERE. Be sure your MT4 is upgraded to at least Build 600 because our new indicators take advantage of new MQL4 code that will not run on previous MT4 versions! Be sure the indicators go into the MQL4/Indicators folder. Access this folder from the opened MT4 platform by clicking on File/Open Data Folder/MQL4/Indicators. If your operating system is Windows 7 or 8 and you have difficulty with the indicators/templates, right click on MT4 icon -> properties -> compatibility win xp sp3. Follow the instructions in the releasing post and read the User Notes at the top of the code of each indicator. That is how, and that is where, you will learn about the features and use of the indicators. The User Notes are sort of a manual for each indicator and a lot of work went into providing them so you can learn what you need to know. So do your homework and read what has been provided instead of asking questions. Do not be surprised if you are ignored when asking a question that would already be answered if you had followed these instructions. We are traders here. We do not have time to "spoon feed". Warning #1: anyone who repeatedly asks questions that indicate they have not done their "homework" here, will be expelled from the thread.

Sonic R. System Manual 
The most recent pdf. can be found HERE. Summary in English HERE. Later version HERE. Summary in Russian HERE. Summary in Spanish HERE.

The "Secret" of the Sonic R. System Classic Setup
Find out why the Sonic R. Classic set ups have been profitable, read the "Secret of Sonic R." pdf. HERE. 

Classics, Scouts, and PVSRA
The Classic setup/trade is the core of the Sonic R. System. I introduced the Scout trade in 2012. The analysis we call PVSRA (for Price, Volume, S&R Analysis) came in 2013 and is intended to help better qualify Classic and Scout trades. Read about Scouts HERE, keeping in mind that a Scout "setup situation" can occur before a Classic trade and during a Classic trade. For PVSRA, read a summary HERE and a pdf. HERE and HERE. Remember, PVSRA is a method of analysis, not a trade entry method. For more information on Sonic R. System entries read HERE, HERE and HERE . The most recent and helpful instruction on the use of PVSRA is in the pdf. HERE. Critical information is HERE. 

Trade Execution
This is the most important aspect of trading. It is about how you make the decision to trade, the mindset you maintain during the trade, and how you manage the trade to protect your capital. See HERE for more information. Do not take this lightly. The market is set up to take your money from you by giving your trade an "accident".

Posting Guidelines
I ask everyone to please remember that this thread is the text book for the Sonic R. System. A post should be neat, clean, clearly understandable, as any picture or diagram would be in a text book. Please use our template. It has the market panel in the upper left of the chart which serves the purpose of clearly identifying the pair ID and TF. If you use the MT4 quick order box that overlays this panel, please click it off before posting! When posting trades, include the entire chart, not just a portion of it. The chart should be well annotated with EP, any TP decided upon, and any SL (if used). Postings of trades opened should be followed up with postings when the trade is added to and when it is closed. These subsequent postings should include the go-back link to the previous post on the trade. All posted charts should be neat and well annotated, so readers can easily comprehend. Sloppiness in posts and annotating charts wastes everybody's time. In other words, in all posts, please be considerate of both the purpose of this thread as a teaching instrument, and of your fellow Sonicers that are trying to grow in the application of the Sonic R. System. Every post should include a picture, Rule #1,.....No pic., no post! Also, do not post indicators on this thread without receiving permission to do so from either Sonic or traderathome. Send a PM to either person stating your reason for wanting to post an indicator not already a part of the Sonic R. System. Warning #2: anyone who repeatedly violates our posting guidelines, indicating they have not done their "homework" here, and that they don't intend to abide by our codes for conduct, will be expelled from the thread.

Trade Unit Size Disclosure Policy
I prefer traders do not disclose the actual size of their trades. My reason is simple. I would feel quite badly if traders passed over this system because in briefly stopping by they assumed from what they saw that the system was for folks with too little or too much money to be of interest to them. We count pips P/L here. The pips could be worth (MOL) $0.10 , or $1.00, or $10.00, undisclosed by the trader as a matter of privacy for them, and as a matter of policy for us. Trade unit size is immaterial. The pips P/L is material. And in this manner, every Sonicer can view every trade from their own perspective. The playing field becomes level for all.

Sonic's Advice for the Newcomers
Just like learning to fly a plane or do a surgical procedure, trading isn't easy either. But it can be learned and understood with proper effort and patience. If you think, or were made to believe, that trading is a "get rich quick" opportunity, you are in for a rude awakening. So, I suggest you read all the material linked in this post #1, read the first couple dozen of my posts, and read at least the last 50 pages of the forum. Start out by focusing on the Classic setup. Have a clear understanding of the essence of this setup (read the "Secret of Sonic R."). Use PVSRA to help qualify Classic setups by looking for confirming PVSRA indications appearing before Classic setups. 

Request of Newcomers
In the past, newcomers asked questions about the Sonic R. System, about abbreviations on our charts and about other things already answered in the material linked in this first post. So, I request everyone that comes here to thoroughly read this first post and all of the linked materials. Pay particular attention to the Sonic R. System Manual and to the post that releases our indicators and templates. All the questions you are likely to have are already answered in these materials. Please understand that we do not have time to repeat answers for everyone that comes here and skips doing this reading. Consider this reading as your first homework assignment. Please read, read, read,.....with care and attentiveness. If you have questions, go back and read some more! Thank you. 

Warning #3 for Newcomers
It seems a shame that such a section as this should even need to be here, but it is necessary so that newcomers will immediately understand and appreciate the extent to which the content of this thread will be protected from pollution. You have already read two "warnings", so this is your final warning. This thread is the most successful thread on Forex Factory in producing profitable traders. Many of the other threads allow any person to post anything. We do not! We expect you to read all that has been provided for you to read, in order that all of your questions are answered without us having to answer them for you, and for everyone else that comes here, individually. We are traders here, and we do not have time to spoon feed every new person. Everything is free here, and the posts in this thread contain a lot of valuable information, just waiting for you to partake of it. If you are too lazy to read, to do your "homework", then do without the information, because we are not going to repeat it again just for you! If you are here, it is presumed you are here to become a Sonicer; to learn and grow in the application of the Sonic R. System. Your posts should be evidence that you have satisfactorily completed your "homework" here. If not, you will be instructed to change. If you do not, you will be expelled. Enough said? If not, then here is additional advice for you and anyone else that either hasn't read the basics or doesn't remember them, or is looking for something that isn't there: just be quiet, read, re-read, read more, watch, listen and learn. 

The Reason
And why am I sharing this, while I do not earn a penny from you for my time and effort? I do so because I believe Sharing is Caring.

The Expectations
I have no commercial interest in sharing this system. You can say thank to me by posting comment in my profile, "vouching" me in my profile

Please don't be a silent lurker. Get yourself involve in this community, sharing with others as well about your experiences and trade set ups. Let's get the ball rolling.
