# Notice

I have moved the repository to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/AmadeusAlgo/ForexTradeGroup).
Any future updates will be there instead.

# Welcome to the Forex Trade Group!

You can use the [wiki](https://github.com/SmartBYtesSG/ForexTradeGroup/wiki) to get started in understanding how to use and contribute to this repository.

Currently we are in the midst of constant updating (including the wiki) so that we can find and settle on a suitable structure on how to evaluate and add relevant strategies into this repository and make it into a network of algos to trade the Forex market efficiently and effectively.

The main code that we use here is MQL4, although we are looking to expand to python using Quantopian's zipline to create models for the Forex market.

Stay tuned for more updates!
